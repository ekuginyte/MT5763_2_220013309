## Abstract

This report summarises the functions created to replicate Monte Carlo simulation and Bootstrapping methods. 

Problem A includes simple Monte Carlo simulation to calculate Pr(X > Y) with given X Normal distribution and Y Uniform distribution. The plotted sample variance distribution shows that the variance gets close to zero as number of MC simulation increases.

Problem B applies MC simulation and bootstrapping to replicate the tournament format and the effect of total number of games played from probability of winning. In the case of the later described in more detail tournament format, ... assumptions?

# Problem A

Include Libraries

```{r Libraries, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Include libraries
library(tidyverse)

library(doParallel)

```


**Monte Carlo Simulation** to compute the probability Pr(X > Y). Refer to result in Table 1.

```{r Monte Carlo Simulation, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Problem A
# Sample size
n <- 1000
# Pre-allocate memory for storing random samples
X <- rep(NA, n)
Y <- rep(NA, n)
prob <- NA
# For reproducibility
set.seed(777)
# Simple Monte Carlo function to calculate probability Pr(X > Y)
# Input:
#  X - samples from normal distribution,
#  Y - samples from uniform distribution.
# Output:
#  prob - probability Pr(X > Y).
my_mc <- function(n) {
  # Generate samples with given boundaries
  X <- rnorm(n, mean = 4, sd = sqrt(10))
  Y <- runif(n, min = 2, max = 8)
  # Compute probability Pr(X > Y)
  prob <- sum(X > Y) / length(X + Y)
  # I wouldn't use return command normally in this place, since the Tidyverse
  # Style Guide advice against it, unless I wanted the return earlier in the 
  # function. However, I have heard this sometimes gets penalised at the 
  # university, hence, the return command at the end of the function.
  return(prob)
}
# Return results in a table
kable(my_mc(n), caption = "Pr(X > Y)")

```

**Bootstrapping method** to derive the sampling distribution for the estimate of Pr(X > Y).

```{r My Bootstrap function, echo = TRUE, }
# Bootstrapping to derive the sampling distribution of Pr(X > Y)
# Sample size
n_repeat <- 10000
# Pre-allocate memory for storing results
boot_res <- rep(NA, n_repeat)
prob_res <- rep(NA, n_repeat)
# For reproducibility
set.seed(555)
# Loop across all samples
# Output:
#  boot_res - store vector of the Pr(X > Y) distribution.
my_bts <- function(n_repeat) {
  # Compute vector of the Pr(X > Y) distribution, parallelise
  prob_res <- foreach(i = 1:n_repeat, .combine = "c") %dopar% {
  my_mc(n)
    }
  # Resample with replacement
  boot_res <- sample(x = prob_res, size = n_repeat, replace = TRUE)
  # Store results
  return(boot_res)
}


```

```{r Plot Bootstrap results, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Save bootstrap results
res_bts <- my_bts(n_repeat)
# Save the mean of the bootstrap results
res_bts_mean <- mean(res_bts)
# Plot the bootstrap results
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = res_bts), colour = "darkgrey", fill = "aliceblue", 
                 bins = 40) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = res_bts_mean, colour = "deepskyblue4", size = 1) +
  xlab("Count") + ylab("Density") +
  ggtitle("My Bootstrap Result") + 
  theme_minimal()
```


Sample variance changes with the number of Monte Carlo Simulations.

```{r Sample Variance Changes, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Number of simulations to run
n_sim <- 10000
# Pre-allocate memory to store vector of variances
sample_variances <- rep(NULL, n)
simulation <- rep(NULL, n)
# For reproducibility
set.seed(222)

# Create function to produce variances as number of Monte Carlo simulations
# increase.
# Input: 
#  n - number of simulations ran.
# Output:
#  sample_variances - vector of Monte Carlo sample variances.
variance_change <- function(n_sim) {
  # Store multiple values of Monte Carlo simulation probabilities Pr(X > Y)
  simulation <- foreach(i = 1:n_sim, .combine = "c") %dopar% {
  my_mc(i)
  }
  # Store each variance of the i:(i + 1) simulations
  sample_variances <- foreach(i = 1:n, .combine = "c") %dopar% {
    var(simulation[1:(i + 1)])
  }
  return(sample_variances)
}

# Save variance distribution to p
p <- variance_change(n_sim)
# Sample variance changes plot
ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(y = p), colour = "darkolivegreen") +
  xlab("Monte Carlo Simulations") +
  ylab("Sample Variance") +
  ggtitle("Sample Variance of The Sampling Distribution") +
  theme_minimal()
```


# Problem B 

Football tournament. A team keeps playing until they accrue 7 wins or 3 losses (whichever comes first - no draws allowed). Assumed fixed win rate p[0, 1] across all rounds (they are paired at random).


```{r, Tournament function, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Count number of games the team needs to play to win or loose the match.
# The team needs to accrue 7 wins or 3 losses (no draws). 
# For reproducibility
set.seed(333)
# Input:
#  w - wins to finish the match,
#  l - losses to finish the match.
# Output:
#  game_n - number of games played for the match to be finished.
tournament <- function(prob) {
  # Pre-allocate memory
  games <- NA
  # Assign counter
  w <- 0
  l <- 0
  # Conditions
  wins <- 7
  loses <- 3
  while(w < wins && l < loses) {
    result <- rbinom(1, 1, prob)
    if(result == 1) {
      w <- w + 1
    } 
    else {
      l <- l + 1
    }
  }
  games <- w + l 
  return(games)
}

# Set p values
p <- seq(0, 1, 0.001)
# Number of times to repeat the function
n_rep <- 1000
# Create function p
p_function <- function(n_rep) {
  # Store results
  result_list <- NULL
  # Create p function with p values on x axis, total games played on y axis
  result_list <- foreach(i = 1:length(p), .combine = "c") %dopar% {
    tournament(p[i])
  }
  return(result_list)
}

```



Plot how the total number of matches played (i.e. wins + losses) varies as a function of p.

```{r, Plot function of p, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Store results of number of games played to plot
games_played <- p_function(n_rep)

# Function p plot
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = p, y = games_played), colour = "azure2", alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = p, y = games_played), colour = "darkslateblue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1)) +
  xlab("p") +
  ylab("Games Played") +
  ggtitle("Games Played from Probability of Winning") +
  theme_minimal()
```


Comment on the observed win rate relative to the assumed win rate p (i.e. if a team obtains 2 wins - 3 losses, the maximum likelihood point estimate for their win rate is 40%). Specifically, focus on the effect driven by the format of this tournament.


# Resample with replacement
  bootData <- obsData[sample(x = N, size = N, replace = T), ]
